### React Decimal Counter

Create a counter is one of the most popular assessments for UI interviews. The basic concept behind counters is to increase the initial count as per user input. The most basic type is the increment count which increases the count on a button click. You will find hundreds of posts and codes for that, but this project focuses on a different kind of counter â€” The Decimal Counter.

The decimal counter increases the initial count by decimal places. Also, we will be saving the count in our local storage so that we don't lose the count on page refresh or when we close the browser/window.
